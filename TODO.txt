Data table PITEMS: 
	change the monetary values from decimal -> bigint (64bit int)
	When displaying, first convert to double, then divide by the ratio
	between the whole and fractional part of the currency, if the currency
	for the locale has a fractional part.
	Input from the user is parsed into a double which is multiplied by the ratio
	and converted into a bigint, which is stored in the database.
