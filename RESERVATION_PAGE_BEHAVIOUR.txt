Reservation page behaviour
==========================

Dates: from must always be less than to
       so if the user selects "from" that comes after "to" then
       the "to" is set to 1 day later than the "from" and vice versa.

Nights: this number controls the date field "to", when changed the
        "to" field is adjusted accordingly
        conversely, when either "from" or "to" is changed this field
        is set accordingly

Guests: this number affects the "rooms" field, when changed it computes
        the minimum number of rooms needed to satisfy the request.
        e.g. if the number is 5 and there is one room of size 4 and another
        of size 1 available then the no. of rooms is 2
        i.e. it uses the largest rooms available to compute the number

no overbook: if "no. of rooms" is larger than availble rooms this is indicated
             in some visual way, perhaps changing the background color of
             the field and/or adding som pop-up text explaining why
